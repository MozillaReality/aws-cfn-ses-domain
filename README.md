# AWS CloudFormation SES Domain Custom Resource

This repository provides an AWS CloudFormation [custom resource][CustomResource] 
for managing Amazon SES domain identities. You can use it to provision an SES sending
and/or receiving domain, and the resulting CloudFormation resource has attributes
that make it easy to manage the related Route 53 (or other DNS provider) records 
in CloudFormation, too.
